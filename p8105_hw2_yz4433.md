## Problem 1

## Problem 2

### Manipulate the Mr.Trash Wheel sheet

``` r
data_mr = read_excel("data/Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(group = "mr")
data_mr = data_mr[,-15:-16]
data_mr[,13] = as.integer(unlist(round(data_mr[,13])))
```

### Manipute the Professor Trash Wheel sheet and make combination

``` r
data_pro = read_excel("data/Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx",2) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  add_column(sports_balls = 0, .after = "chip_bags") %>% 
  mutate(group = "professor")
data_pro[,3] = as.character(unlist(data_pro[,3]))
data_trash =
  bind_rows(data_mr, data_pro) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(group, everything())
```

For Mr. Trash Wheel data, a 547 $\times$ 15 dataset, the key variables
are date and weight_tons, and it illustrates the amount of total litter
and litter type from May 2014 to July 2022. For Professor Trash Wheel
data, a 94 $\times$ 15 dataset, the key variables are also date and
weight_tons, and it illustrates the amount of precipitation and litter
type from Jan 2017 to July 2022. The final resulting dataset has 641
observations. The key variables are date and weight_tons. After
calculation, the total weight of trash collected by Professor Trash
Wheel is 190.12, and the total number of sports balls collected by
Mr. Trash Wheel in 2020 is 213.93.
